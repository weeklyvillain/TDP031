4-1 Use dig to answer the following questions. If the tests below fail, do this for www.ida.liu.se.
a) What is the address of parlomba1.ida.liu.se.
    Didn't work for parlomba1.ida.liu.se so we did the questions with ida.liu.se
    dig ida.liu.se
    Answer: 130.236.180.77

b) Which nameservers have authoritative information for parlomba1.ida.liu.se.
    dig -t NS ida.liu.se
    ns.ida.liu.se
    ns1.liu.se
    ns2.liu.se

c) Which name corresponds to the IPv4 address 130.236.180.77.
    dig -x 130.236.180.77
    informatix.ida.liu.se.

4-2 Use the trace feature of dig to answer the following questions.
a) What nameservers are consulted in a query for the A record of www.ida.liu.se.
    dig -t A ida.liu.se +trace
    ;; Received 525 bytes from 130.236.1.9#53(130.236.1.9) in 0 ms
    ;; Received 977 bytes from 193.0.14.129#53(k.root-servers.net) in 28 ms
    ;; Received 607 bytes from 130.239.5.114#53(g.ns.se) in 18 ms
    ;; Received 1184 bytes from 130.236.6.252#53(ns3.liu.se) in 0 ms
    ;; Received 152 bytes from 130.236.48.9#53(nsauth.isy.liu.se) in 0 ms

b) What nameservers are consulted when determining the address of update.microsoft.com? Note that the presence of a CNAME record makes this question different from the previous one: you will need to run dig more than once to get the answer.
    dig -t A update.microsoft.com +trace | grep 'Received'
    dig -t A update.microsoft.com.nsatc.net +trace | grep 'Received'
