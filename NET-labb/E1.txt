1-1 Review the documentation for the ping utility and answer the following questions.
a) What is the ping utility used for?
    The ping utility is used for checking if the system can access a server.
b) What command-line option to ping causes it to print numerical addresses.
    ping <IP> -n
c) How does the ping utility work.
    Ping uses the ECHO_REQUEST from the ICMP protocol to get a ECHO_RESPONSE from a host
    or gateway. 
d) How can you detect if the host 10.17.1.1 is up.
    ping 10.17.1.1, then check if we get a response.

1-2 Review the documentation for the traceroute utility and answer the following questions.
a) What is the traceroute utility used for.
    Traceroute is used to track the path that a packet takes from my computer to
    the computer/server.
b) How does traceroute work.
    Traceroute launches probe packets with a shrot TTL (time to live) and then listen for 
    a ICMP "time exceeded" reply, the TTL starts at 1 and is increased until it gets a
    ICMP "port unreachable". When it gets a ICMP "port unreachable" it means that it 
    got to the destination or it hit a max.
c) What command-line option causes traceroute to print numerical addresses.
    -n
d) Use traceroute with a remote host of your choosing as the target. Explain all the output.
    traceroute ida.liu.se
    traceroute to ida.liu.se (130.236.180.77), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
    1  gw-10-253-192.clients.eduroam.liu.se (10.253.192.1)  9.524 ms  9.482 ms  9.459 ms
    2  fw--a-beb.net.liu.se (130.236.0.9)  5.943 ms  4.339 ms  9.419 ms
    3  a-core--a-beb.net.liu.se (130.236.6.5)  9.410 ms  8.357 ms  9.378 ms
    4  130.236.6.208 (130.236.6.208)  9.380 ms  9.371 ms  9.369 ms
    5  informatix.ida.liu.se (130.236.180.77)  8.531 ms  9.350 ms  9.331 ms

    The first column is the server namn and in parenthesis the IP adress for that server.
    after that there is 3 different times that the displaces the RTT (Round Trip Times)
    for each of the packets. It sends 3 different packages to each server, hence the
    3 times.

1-3:
b) How do you display the current routing table using ip?
    ip route

1-4 sysctl command and answer the following.
a) What is a sysctl (not what does the command do, but what a sysctl actually is).
    Sysctl is a software utility, it reads attributes and modifies attributes of the system kernal.
b) In what file can you place sysctl values so they are loaded at boot time.
    /etc/sysctl1.conf or create a file ending with .conf in /etc/sysctl.d/
c) Which sysctl controls IP forwarding.
    sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
1-5 Think of which addresses your hosts should use? Which names? Which netmasks and broadcast addresses?
    Names: Server, Client1, Client2, Router
    Netmask: 255.255.255.0
    Addresses: 192.168.0.1 -> 192.168.0.254
    Broadcast: 192.168.0.255
1-6 Explain the difference between routing and forwarding (as related to IP networking).
    Routing is the set of roules that defines how to send a packet forward.
    Forwarding is the actual act of sending a packet forward.
