7-1 Answer the following questions.
a) What configuration file controls NSS.
    /etc/nsswitch.conf
b) What configuration file controls the resolver.
    /etc/resolv.conf
c) What does the "search" keyword in the resolver configuration file do.
    It defines domains that is searched when a hostname doesn't contain
    a dot. For example if we have the entry:
        search  a.b.c d.b.c
    If we query for X it will first try X.a.b.c, if that doesn't return a
    match it will then try for X.d.b.c. If that fails it wont try anything
    else.
