iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ens3 -j MASQUERADE
-t = tables ( we are going to modify the NAT table )
-A = Append and as parameter what rule-specification ( POSTROUTING )
-o = out-interface, what interface the packet is going to be sent through ( ens3 )
-j = jump, the target of the rule. Masquerade "hides" everything behind
     the host, so if client-1 sends a request to liu.se the router
     will make it so the request looks like it came from the router. liu.se
     wont know that the request came from client-1, it will think that it
     came from the router.
